Climbing game

Climb Time is a cross-platform rhythm game. The game is set on a rock-climbing wall of infinite length that is generated as the game goes on.
As described in the games' rules:

Welcome to Climb Time! 
Click and drag one of the character's hands or feet to make a move.
At the beginning of each move your strength timer will start counting down.
Release the mouse button over a hold before the timer runs out to avoid falling off.
Your energy will decrease as you climb up the wall.
The round ends when you run out of energy or if the strength timer expires before the successful completion of a move.
At the end of each round, you will be prompted to increase either you max energy or max strength.
